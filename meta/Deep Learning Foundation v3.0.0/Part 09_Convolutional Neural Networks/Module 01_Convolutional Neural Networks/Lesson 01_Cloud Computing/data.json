Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) - An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.\n2. Choose an Instance Type -  Instance Type offers varying combinations of CPUs, memory (GB), storage (GB), types of network performance, and availability of IPv6 support. AWS offers a variety of Instance Types, broadly categorized in 5 categories. You can choose an Instance Type that fits our use case. The specific type of GPU instance you should launch for this tutorial is called __“p2.xlarge”__.\n3. Configure Instance Details - Provide the instance count and configuration details, such as, network, subnet, behavior, monitoring, etc. \n4. Add Storage - You can choose to attach either *SSD* or *Standard Magnetic* drive to your instance. \n5. Add Tags - A tag serves as a *label* that you can attach to multiple AWS resources, such as volumes, instances or both. \n6. Configure Security Group - Attach a set of firewall rules to your instance(s) that controls the incoming traffic to your instance(s). \n7. Review - Review your instance launch details before the launch.\n",

For example, [this demo](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html) that uses a trained RNN to generate new sketches given user input.\n\nYou'll learn all about deployment later in this program, so we'll revisit the necessary instance-creation information, when we get there.
