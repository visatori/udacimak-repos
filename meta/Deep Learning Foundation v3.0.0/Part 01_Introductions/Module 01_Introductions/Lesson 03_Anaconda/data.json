It's simple to install packages with Anaconda and create virtual environments to work on multiple projects conveniently. \n\n\nEven if you already have Python installed, it will be beneficial to use Anaconda/Miniconda because:\n1. Anaconda comes with a bunch of data science packages; you'll be all set to start working with data. \n2. Using `conda` to manage your packages and environments will reduce future issues dealing with the various libraries you'll be using.\n\n\n## Python Packages\nA package is a bunch of modules, where each module consists of a set of classes and function definitions. After installing a particular package, you can `import` and use the functions defined in that package. \n\nIf we install Anaconda, then a basic few packages are installed by default. However, you can install any more packages, if needed.  \n\n## Anaconda Distribution\nAnaconda is a fairly large download (~500 MB) because it comes with Python's most common data science packages. [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/overview/) is a software distribution that includes the following:\n\n* **Anaconda Navigator** - It is a graphical user interface that helps open up any installed applications, such as Jupyter notebook or VS code editor. We will learn more about the notebook in the next lesson. See a snapshot of Anaconda Navigator below:\n",

Your first command should be \n```\nconda --version\n```\nIf you are not comfortable on the command line, check out the [command prompt tutorial for Windows](https://www.lynda.com/-tutorials/Windows-command-line-basics/497312/513424-4.html) or our [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595) course for OSX/Linux.\n\n* **Python** - The latest version of Python gets installed as an individual package. \n* Over 160 scientific packages and their dependencies are also installed. \n\nIf you don't need all the packages or need to conserve bandwidth or storage space,  there is an option for you -  **Miniconda**.\n\n--- \n\n## Miniconda\n**Either Anaconda or Miniconda is adequate for this course.** [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a smaller distribution as compared to Anaconda, which includes only `conda` and Python. Miniconda can do everything Anaconda is capable of, but **doesn't have the preinstalled packages**. You can still install any of the available packages using `conda install PACKAGENAME` on the terminal/Anaconda Prompt. Interestingly, you can anytime upgrade from Miniconda to Anaconda by using the command:\n```\nconda install anaconda\n```\nIn the command above, did you notice that we followed the same `conda install PACKAGENAME` syntax? See an example below to install the Numpy package with conda on the Terminal/Anaconda Prompt.

On the next page, we will see details to install Anaconda/Miniconda. However, the `pip` also comes preinstalled with the Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4. \n\nIn case if you have Anaconda/Miniconda already installed, and don't have `pip` in your system, there are two ways:\n\n1. Refer to the [Pip installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) \n2. Install `conda` first and then install pip using conda. We will see commands for this step on the very next page because we will learn to install Anaconda/Miniconda next. \n\n\n### Which one should I prefer - `pip` or `conda`?\nThere are two points you can consider before making a choice:\n1. The available packages available from the Anaconda distribution in `conda` focus on data science, whereas `pip` is for general use. Conda installs precompiled packages. For example, the Anaconda distribution comes with Numpy, Scipy, and Scikit-learn compiled with the [MKL library](https://docs.continuum.io/mkl-optimizations/), speeding up various math operations. **But, sometimes, you may need packages other than the ones listed on the Anaconda distribution.**\n2. Pip can install both Python and non-Python packages. Pip can install any package listed on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI). \n\n**You can (and will) still use `pip` alongside `conda` to install packages.**\n\n--- \n\n## Environments\nA Python environment comprises a particular version of each of the following:\n* Python interpreter, \n* Python-packages, and\n* The utility scripts, such as pip.  \nIt is possible to have two or more environments residing on the same computer *virtually*.

It's similar to [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv), other popular environment managers. \n\n### Why do  you need a Virtual Environment?\nEach virtual environment remains isolated from other virtual environments, and the default “system”  environment.  **Environments allow you to separate and isolate the packages you are using for different projects.** Often you’ll be working with code that depends on different versions of some library. For example, you could have code that uses new features in Numpy, or code that uses old features that have been removed. It’s practically impossible to have two versions of Numpy installed at once. Instead, you should make an environment for each version of Numpy then work in the appropriate environment for the project.\n\nThis issue also happens a lot when dealing with Python 2 and Python 3. You might be working with old code that doesn’t run in Python 3 and new code that doesn’t run in Python 2. Having both installed can lead to a lot of confusion and bugs. It’s much better to have separate environments.\n\nYou can also export the list of packages in an environment to a file, then include that file with your code. This allows other people to easily load all the dependencies for your code. Pip has similar functionality with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.\n\n## Where we go from here\nNext, I'll get into the details of using Anaconda. First I'll cover installing it, then using the package manager, and finally creating and managing environments.\n",

              "text": "# Installing Anaconda\n\nAnaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Follow the links below to get started:\n1. Download the installer from  [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Choose the Python 3.7 or higher version, and the appropriate 64/32-bit installer. If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.\n\n\n2. Refer the installation instructions [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)\n\n3. Verify the installation [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/) for your respective OS\n\n\n\nAfter installation, you’re automatically in the default conda environment with all packages installed which you can see below. You can check out your own install by entering the following command into your terminal.\n```\nconda list\n```\n\n<video loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_default_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n\n## List of Applications Installed with Anaconda\nAs we read on the previous page, the following packages will get installed with Anaconda:\n* **Anaconda Navigator** - a GUI for managing your environments and packages\n* **`conda`** - a command-line utility\n* **Python** - The latest version of Python gets installed as an individual package. \n* **Anaconda Prompt** - [Only for Windows] a terminal where you can use the command-line interface to manage your environments and packages\n* A bunch of applications, such as **Spyder**. It is an IDE geared toward scientific development. In total, over 160 scientific packages and their dependencies are also installed. \n\n\n\n\nTo avoid errors later, it's best to update all the packages in the default environment. Open the Terminal/ Anaconda Prompt application. In the prompt, run the following commands:\n\n    conda upgrade conda\n    conda upgrade --all\n\nand answer yes when asked if you want to install the packages. The packages that come with the initial install tend to be out of date, so updating them now will prevent future errors from out of date software.\n\n>**Note:** In the previous step, running `conda upgrade conda` should not be necessary because `--all` includes the conda package itself, but some users have encountered errors without it.\n\n---\n \nIn the rest of this lesson, you'll learn to use commands in your Terminal/Anaconda Prompt. I highly suggest you start working with command-line utility first, then later use the GUI if you'd like. Once you get acquainted with the command-line utility, refer to the [Starter Guide for Anaconda distribution (GUI)](https://docs.anaconda.com/_downloads/9ee215ff15fde24bf01791d719084950/Anaconda-Starter-Guide.pdf).\n\n## Troubleshooting Resources\nIf you are facing difficulty in installing and running conda, refer to the FAQ - [Should I add Anaconda to the macOS/Linux/Windows PATH?](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/). Additionally, the following links might be useful:\n1. Linux/macOS - \n * If you are seeing the \"conda command not found\" and are using ZShell, you have to add `export PATH=\"/Users/USERNAME/opt/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"` to your .zsh_config file.\n\n2. Windows users - \n * ['export' is not recognized as an internal or external command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26368306/export-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)\n * ['Conda' is not recognized as internal or external command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44515769/conda-is-not-recognized-as-internal-or-external-command)\n",

              "text": "# Managing Packages\n\n## Install Packages\nOnce you have Anaconda installed, managing packages is fairly straightforward. To install a package, type the following command in your terminal. \n```\nconda install PACKAGE_NAME\n```\nFor example, to install numpy, type `conda install numpy`.\n\n<video controls loop autoplay>\n  <source src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud1111/conda_install.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\nYou can install multiple packages at the same time. For example, the command below will install all three packages simultaneously.\n```\nconda install numpy scipy pandas\n```\nIt's also possible to specify which version of a package you want by adding the version number such as `conda install numpy=1.10`.\n\nConda also automatically installs dependencies for you. For example `scipy` uses and requires `numpy`. If you install just `scipy` (`conda install scipy`), Conda will also install `numpy` if it isn't already installed.\n\n## Remove Packages\nMost of the commands are pretty intuitive. To uninstall, use \n```\nconda remove PACKAGE_NAME\n``` \n\n## Update Packages\nTo update a package, use \n```\nconda update package_name\n``` \nIf you want to update all packages in an environment, which is often useful, use `conda update --all`. And finally, to list installed packages, it's `conda list` which you've seen before.\n\n## Search a Package to Install\nIf you don't know the exact name of the package you're looking for, you can try searching with `conda search *SEARCH_TERM*`. For example, I know I want to install [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), but I'm not sure of the exact package name. So, I try `conda search *beautifulsoup*`. Note that your shell might expand the wildcard `*` before running the conda command. To fix this, wrap the search string in single or double quotes like `conda search '*beautifulsoup*'`.\n",

Download Python packages in Anaconda Terminal\n3. Setup and manage one or more environments\n\nBelow are a few best practices that you can consider to incorporate in your programming habit.  \n\n## Using Environments\nOne thing that’s helped me tremendously is having separate environments for Python 2 and Python 3. I used the commands below to create two separate environments - `py2_env` and `py3_env`, \n```bash\nconda create -n py2_env python=2\nconda create -n py3_env python=3`\n```\n \nNow, I have a general use environment for each Python version. In each of those environments, I've installed most of the standard data science packages (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.). Remember that when you set up an environment initially, you'll only start with the standard packages in addition to whatever packages you specify in your `conda create` statement.\n\nI’ve also found it useful to create environments for each project I’m working on. It works great for non-data related projects too, like web apps with Flask. For example, I have an environment for my personal blog using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/). \n\n## Sharing Environments\nWhen sharing your code on GitHub, it's good practice to make an environment file and include it in the repository. You can do this using `conda` as: \n```\nconda env export > environment.yaml\n```\n\n\n## Share the List of Dependencies\nFor users not using conda, you may want to share the list of packages installed in the current environment. You can use `pip` to generate such a list as `requirements.txt` file using:\n```bash\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\nLater, you can share this `requirements.txt` file with other users over Github. Once a user (or yourself) switches to another environment, you can install all the packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file using:\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nYou can [learn more here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/) about using `pip` instead of `conda`. This will make it easier for people to install all the dependencies for your code. \n\n## Recommended Read\n* To learn more about conda and how it fits in the Python ecosystem, check out this article by Jake Vanderplas: [Conda myths and misconceptions](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/). \n* Here's the [conda glossary documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/glossary.html) for your reference.\n",

              "text": "# Python versions at Udacity\n\nMost Nanodegree programs at Udacity will be (or are already) using Python 3 almost exclusively. \n\n## Why we're using Python 3\n\n* Jupyter is [switching to Python 3 only](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version6.html#python-3-only-codebase)\n* Python 2.7 is [being retired](https://pythonclock.org/)\n* Python 3 has been out for almost 10 years, and there are very few dependencies (and none in this Nanodegree)  that are incompatible.\n\nAt this point, there are enough new features in Python 3 that it doesn't make much sense to stick with Python 2. You should write Python code for version 3. Read more [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).\n\n## The main breakage between Python 2 and 3\n\nFor the most part, the Python 2 code will work with Python 3. Of course, most new features introduced with Python 3 versions won't be backward compatible. The place where your Python 2 code will fail most often is the `print` statement. See the change in the syntax below:\n\n```python\n# Print statement in Python 2\nprint \"Hello\", \"world!\"\n\n# Print statement in Python 3\nprint(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n```\n    \nIf you want your `print()` function to work in both Python 2 and 3 versions, you'll need to import the `print_function` in your Python 2.6+ code. The `print()` function was backported to Python 2.6+ through the `__future__` module:\n```python\n# Python 3 `print()` function can run in Python 2.6+ after an `import` statement.\n# In Python 2.6+\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nprint(\"Hello\", \"world!\")\n\n# Python 2 `print` statement cannot run in Python 3.\n# The following line of code will NOT work in Python 3\nprint \"Hello\", \"world!\"\n```\n",
